# Discurso Y Dolor
In this project, funded by FONDECYT, I was supervised by Prof. Mariana Pascual from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.  
My goal was to study a corpus of interviews with patients diagnosed with endometriosis. The disease causes chronic pain, and takes in average 7 to 10 years to diagnose. This delay is often due to failures in patient-doctor communication.  

Questions that were the basis of the project:
1. What are the patterns that the patients use in discourse? 
2. How can physicians be more precise in early diagnostics through language?
3. Which language resources do patients recur to express their pain?
