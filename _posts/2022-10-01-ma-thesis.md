# Gender bias in Brazilian Portuguese

My work focuses on understanding gender bias in Brazilian Portuguese. The current approach is to use fine-tuned BERTimbau (Brazilian Portuguese model from BERT) for a classification task, and research on literature about Gender and Sociolinguistics. I aim to test hypotheses on how gender is marked in Brazilian Portuguese speeches from different types of texts (political speeches, reviews on the Internet, oral corpora).
