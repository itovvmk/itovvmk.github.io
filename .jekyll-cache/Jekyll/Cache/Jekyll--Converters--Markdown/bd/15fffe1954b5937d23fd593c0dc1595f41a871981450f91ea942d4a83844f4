<p>In this project, funded by FONDECYT, I was supervised by Prof. Mariana Pascual from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.<br />
My goal was to study a corpus of interviews with patients diagnosed with endometriosis. The disease causes chronic pain, and takes in average 7 to 10 years to diagnose. This delay is often due to failures in patient-doctor communication.</p>

<p>Questions that were the basis of the project:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What are the patterns that the patients use in discourse?</li>
  <li>How can physicians be more precise in early diagnostics through language?</li>
  <li>Which language resources do patients recur to express their pain?</li>
</ol>
