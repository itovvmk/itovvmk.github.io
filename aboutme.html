            <h1>A Few Words</h1>

            Hi! I am Viviane, but everybody calls me Vivi. 
            <br><br>
            I am Brazilian but my family is originally from Japan (although my grandma was born in Korea, during the Japanese occupation). 
            After spending more than 10 years working in advertising, I am making a career shift to being a full-time linguist. 
            My family background, a passion on understanding how things work, and the intense multicultural Brazilian environment influenced 
            me on making this choice.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I am a Master's student in Linguistics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. Right now, I am located in New York, 
            getting ready to pursue a PhD in Linguistics. 
            My main research focus is on Computational Linguistics methods, especially applied to Sociolinguistics and Psycholinguistics. 
            I am also interested on Linguistics Typology, African Linguistics and Multilingualism.
            <br><br>
            I am also a yogi, barista, and worked as a volunteer in a dog shelter in Thailand. I have a rescued dog, Fiapo, which is in the picture below :)
